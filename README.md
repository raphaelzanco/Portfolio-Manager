## üí°About The Project
Nowadays, investors have access to a large pool of financial products, being able to expose themselves to a large variety of markets (Stocks, Bonds, REITs, ETFs, and so on).
However, even though a diverse portfolio can minimize some risks, it also makes it all the more complex to keep track of.

While a smart investment strategy is key, accurately tracking your transactions, asset distribution, and performance history is crucial for managing risk and planning your next steps.

## üöÄGetting Started
**üìåWarning: This program was built and test in a Linux Environment. 
Unexpected behaviours may occur if runned in a Windows System**

Follow the steps bellow to compile and run the program:

**1. Download the files**
   
Download all .hpp and .cpp the inside the "Source Code" folder as well as the shell script "compilePortfolioManager.sh".

The .hpp and .cpp files are the heart of this program ! It won't work without them. The shellscript will help you save time and compile all files into an exacutable one.

**Make sure to place them all in the same directory !**

If you didn't open your directory path in your terminal, use the *"cd <directory>"* command to go inside the folder you stored this projects files.

**3. Make the shell script executable**

Run the line ahead to make your shell script executable: *"chmod +x compilePortfolioManager.sh"*.

**4. Compile the program**

Run the shell script with *"./compilePortfolioManager.sh"*. Afterwards, you're expected to receive an executable file called portfolioManager

**5. Run the application**

Once the script finishes, start the program with the command *"./portfolioManager"*.

Now, have a good time !

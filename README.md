## ðŸ’¡About The Project
Nowadays, investors have access to a large pool of financial products, being able to expose themselves to a large variety of markets (Stocks, Bonds, REITs, ETFs, and so on).
However, even though a diverse portfolio can minimize some risks, it also makes it all the more complex to keep track of.

While a smart investment strategy is key, accurately tracking your transactions, asset distribution, and performance history is crucial for managing risk and planning your next steps.
